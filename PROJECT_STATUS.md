## üìã Project Overview

### Mission Statement
**"Making high-quality interactive education freely accessible to everyone through open source technology"**

Viveka is an open source interactive learning platform designed to transform traditional education through:
- Interactive simulations and virtual labs
- CBSE curriculum-aligned content (initially)
- Community-driven development
- Free access for all students and teachers globally

### Core Philosophy
- **Open Source First:** MIT License, community-owned
- **Content-Centric:** Static HTML files with rich interactions
- **Minimal Backend:** Add complexity only when necessary
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Works everywhere, enhanced where possible
- **Educational Equity:** Free access regardless of economic background

### Development Approach: STEP-BY-STEP METHODOLOGY
**CRITICAL:** We follow a deliberate step-by-step approach to avoid complexity and ensure each piece works before moving forward.

#### Step-by-Step Principles:
1. **One Thing at a Time:** Complete each step fully before moving to next
2. **Test Each Step:** Verify functionality before adding complexity
3. **Simple First:** Start with basic structure, enhance gradually
4. **No Rushing:** Resist urge to build everything at once
5. **Document Progress:** Update status document with each step
6. **Professional Consistency:** Maintain consistent design and experience throughout
7. **Only Show What Works:** If something doesn't work, don't display it on screen
8. **No Meaningless Content:** Every element on screen should serve a purpose

#### Design & Consistency Standards:
- **Visual Consistency:** Unified color scheme, typography, and spacing across all pages
- **Navigation Consistency:** Same breadcrumb style, button behavior, and layout patterns
- **Content Standards:** Consistent metadata, file naming, and structure
- **User Experience:** Professional, polished feel that builds trust with educators
- **Mobile-First Design:** Responsive across all devices and screen sizes
- **Accessibility:** WCAG compliant, screen reader friendly, keyboard navigation

#### Why Step-by-Step Works:
- **Reduces Errors:** Easier to debug small, focused changes
- **Builds Confidence:** Success at each step motivates continued progress
- **Maintains Quality:** Each piece is solid before building on top
- **Easier Collaboration:** Clear progress points for team members
- **Prevents Overwhelm:** Large project broken into manageable pieces
- **Ensures Consistency:** Design patterns established early and maintained
- **User Trust:** Only functional content builds credibility with educators
- **Clean Interface:** No clutter or confusing placeholder content
